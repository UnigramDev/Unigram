3. Clone the repository __*recursively*__ `git clone --recursive https://github.com/UnigramDev/Unigram.git`.
4. Create a new file inside `Unigram/Unigram/Unigram.Api` and name it `Constants.Secret.cs`: 
```csharp
namespace Telegram.Api
{
    public static partial class Constants
    {
        static Constants()
        {
            ApiId = your_api_id;
            ApiHash = "your_api_hash";
        }
    }
}
```
5. Replace `your_api_id` and `your_api_hash` with the data obtained from step 2.
