# Unigram
Unigram – An Universal take on Telegram. Made by the community, for the community

Windows 10 (Mobile) introduced with the Universal Windows Platform a whole list of features to make your (chatting) life easier. However, the current official Telegram-app has no signs of releasing an UWP-version with these capabilities soon. That’s why we decided to build our own.

Build instructions:
-
* Go to https://my.telegram.org/apps and register a new app.
* Create a new file inside `Unigram/Unigram/Unigram.Api` called `Constants.Secret.cs`:
```csharp
namespace Telegram.Api
{
    public static partial class Constants
    {
        static Constants()
        {
            FirstServerIpAddress = "your_server_ip"; //DO NOT INCLUDE THE PORT

            ApiId = your_api_id;
            ApiHash = "your_api_hash";
        }
    }
}
```

Our main goal:
-
Make chatting via Telegram fun and engaging. How? By building an app that’s fast, functional and easy to use.


At first we’ll aim to build an experience that’s feature wise on par with the current WP-app. After that we’ll have more time to implement extra functions to make the app even better to use!
