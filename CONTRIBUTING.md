**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that developers might not want to merge into the project. To avoid that, you can join the official [Unigram group](https://t.me/unigraminsiders) and explain what you are wishing to do.
