## Using the issue tracker
The [issue tracker](https://github.com/UnigramDev/Unigram/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), feature requests and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following rules:

* **Do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* **Do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or "üëç". Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead.

## Bug reports
A bug is a _demonstrable problem_. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

To report bugs please follow the default template and fill every section, that would speed up our understanding of the reported problem and an eventual fix of the problem.

## Pull requests
**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that developers might not want to merge into the project. To avoid that, you can join the official [Unigram group](https://t.me/unigraminsiders) or open an issue.
